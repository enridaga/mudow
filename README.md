#Â MuDOW: SPARQL queries

The following selection of SPARQL queries is meant to be a useful guide to the user who wants to discover which musical data is available on the web and how to reuse it! 

MuDOW RDF dataset can be queried at [https://data.open.ac.uk/sparql](https://data.open.ac.uk/sparql). 

Be sure to include the FROM clause [FROM <http://data.open.ac.uk/context/mudow>](http://data.open.ac.uk/context/mudow) to query MuDOW graph. 
Here an example resource for starting browsing the dataset: [MIDI Linked Dataset](http://data.open.ac.uk/mudow/2c52e5179258305c74fcc637615eb123).

**GQ1.** How many resources have been included in the survey?

<pre>
SELECT (COUNT(?s) as ?count)
FROM &lt;http://data.open.ac.uk/context/mudow&gt;
WHERE {
   ?s &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/homepage&gt; ?o .
}
</pre> 

**GQ2.** Which types of resource have been included in the survey?

<pre>
PREFIX rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;
SELECT ?label (count(DISTINCT ?resource) AS ?count) 
FROM &lt;http://data.open.ac.uk/context/mudow&gt;
WHERE {
   	?resource <http://purl.org/spar/datacite/hasGeneralResourceType> ?type .
   	?type rdfs:label ?label .
}

GROUP BY ?label ?count
ORDER BY desc(?count)
</pre> 

**GQ3.** Which criteria have been used to gather such resources? How many resources have been gathered by means of a criterion?

<pre>
PREFIX rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;
SELECT DISTINCT ?searchCriterion ?label (count(?s) AS ?count)
FROM &lt;http://data.open.ac.uk/context/mudow&gt;

  ?size rdfs:label ?label .
}
GROUP BY ?label
ORDER BY ?label
</pre> 

**GQ5.** What is the main data source of gathered resources? 

Results refer to the original musical object described in the resource i.e. audio files, metadata or symbolic notations.

FROM &lt;http://data.open.ac.uk/context/mudow&gt;

SELECT (count(DISTINCT ?resource) AS ?count) ?audience
FROM &lt;http://data.open.ac.uk/context/mudow&gt;
WHERE {
  ?resource &lt;http://purl.org/dc/terms/audience&gt; ?typeaudience .
  ?typeaudience rdfs:label ?audience .

ORDER BY ?count
</pre>
